# Project Organization - 
We followed the SCRUM methodology for this project development.We have several sprint and after the end of each sprint we review the work done on that time and check if the target is achieved or not.

## Sprint - 1 - 
### The main objective of this sprint is write the protocol document.
 |ID|Task Name|Hours Spend|Remarks|
 |---------------|--------------|-------------|----------|
 |#1|Understand the full requirements of this project|||
 |#2|Study about the Blockchain working|||
|#3|Study about the peer to peer networking|||
|#4|Define the types of messages that are transmitted in the peer to peer network|||
|#5|Design the structure of messages that are transmitted in the peer to peer network|||
|#6|Write the protocol document according to the message types defined with format of each message|||

## Sprint - 2 - 
### The main objective of this sprint is develop a working blockchain without networking.
 |ID|Task Name|Hours Spend|Remarks|
 |---------------|--------------|-------------|----------|
 |#1|Design the structure of the Blockchain|||
 |#2|Design the modules required for the creating the working BlockChain||||#3|Design the module for the Asymmetric Cryptography which include the public and private key generation ,Message Encryption and Decryption|||
|#4|Create the modules to make transactions,transaction ledger|||
|#5|Create a module to make the block as per the structure designed|||
|#6|Create a module to calculate  the Merkel Root of all transactions in the ledger|||
|#7|Create a module to Mine the created Block as per difficulty target and calculate the nonce|||
|#8|Create a module to calculate the Genesis Block(First block in the block chain)|||
|#9|Complete the testing of the above modules and make sure that all are working as per the requirement |||

## Sprint - 3 -
