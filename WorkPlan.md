## Plan of Action ##

* First phase of the excecution is to make full working blockchain

For a start first we work for the below things

* Block Structure
* Transaction Message Structure
* Transaction List 

## Work Assignement

# Tasks for implementing working Blockchain

* Making Transactions
* Assymmetric Cryptography - which include authentication and confidentiality - Encryption and Decryption
* Merkel Root calcualtion
* Block Creation
* Finding hash of the block 
* Block Mining - Proof of work
* Add the mined block to the blockchain
* Genesis Block

* Now we know what exactly in the block chain. So now we need to complete the above modules .Informed the team about this topic and select the interested topic amoung them and individually work on each and complete the modules.Also need to do the testing.
